# signals-backtesting

(This repo is unmaintained, and it dates back to when I didn't know about packaging, virtual environments, etc. I am leaving it here for historical purposes)

This was a project I started because I wanted to prove whether or not certain people from the trading community were **actually** profitable, as they were claiming, or if they were manipulating the numbers. I was also curious about how to backtest trading strategies, and how to optimize them.

The idea behind this project is to get data from a telegram channel where signals are sent, parse the signals, and backtest them. The backtesting is done using the [MetaTrader5](https://pypi.org/project/MetaTrader5/) library.

You can see the results of my research [here](https://github.com/965311532/backtesting-results).
